## Brand Story

Deep Roots Nursery is more than a plant store — it's the culmination of a dream that started when Chase Johnson was just ten years old, doing yard work for neighbors in Old River-Winfree. Today, Chase and his wife Madison operate a full-service nursery and landscape company that recently expanded by acquiring Donath's Garden Works and Chase's Yard Care & Landscaping. With 3,275 Facebook followers and growing, Deep Roots has become the go-to source for plants, landscape materials, and expert advice in the Mont Belvieu, Baytown, and greater Houston area. What sets them apart isn't just their inventory — it's the hands-on experience that comes from Chase literally growing up in the landscaping business, learning every aspect of the trade from the ground up.

## Competitive Context

Deep Roots Nursery competes with Coastal Landscape Supplies (located on FM 1409 N in Old River-Winfree, has website at coastallandscapesupplies.com), Maas Nursery (full-service landscape design since 1951, located in nearby Seabrook), and big-box retailers like Lowe's and Home Depot in Baytown. The nearest competitor is Coastal Landscape Supplies, approximately 2 miles north on FM 1409. Deep Roots differentiates through its combination of nursery retail AND professional landscape services (via Chase's Yard Care), allowing customers to buy plants and materials and optionally hire the same company for installation. The recent acquisitions position Deep Roots as a growing, ambitious operation while maintaining the personal touch of owner-operated service.

### Design Direction

**Use the Landscaping / Lawn Care / Tree Service preset from industry-design-presets.md:**

- **Palette:** Natural greens (#2d6a30, #4a8c50), earth tones (#6b5b40, #8b7355), clean white. NOT neon green. Think well-maintained lawn, not toxic highlighter.
- **Typography:** Clean modern sans (Outfit, Source Sans Pro). Professional, not decorative. The type should be clean like their work.
- **Hero image:** Unsplash search: "landscaping nursery", "garden center plants", "landscape design", "nursery trees plants", "garden plants flowers"
- **Vibe:** Fresh, natural, professional. The kind of meticulous care that shows in every edge and line. NOT cheap mow-and-go, NOT garden center.
- **Layout notes:** Product categories should feel organized like nursery sections. Delivery service and landscape partnership are key differentiators to highlight. Location/directions section is important for rural customers.
- **Key sections:** Services (seasonal breakdown), nursery products, landscape services, delivery info, location/directions, owner story

---

### CRITICAL — DO NOT DO THESE THINGS

These are the patterns that make AI-generated sites look amateur. Avoid every single one:

1. **No translateY hover float effects on cards.** Real sites don't make every element levitate on hover. Use subtle border-color changes or opacity shifts only on genuinely interactive elements (buttons, links).

2. **No icon-in-a-rounded-square as the repeated visual motif.** Do not put Font Awesome icons inside 48-52px colored/bordered squares and repeat that pattern in every section. If you use icons at all, use them inline with text or as small accents — not as the centerpiece of every card.

3. **No identical section structure repeated.** Do NOT use the same "pill tag → section title → subtitle → card grid" skeleton for every section. Each section should have its own distinct layout. Mix full-width sections, asymmetric two-column layouts, centered single-column text, large pull quotes, etc.

4. **No colored accent cards to indicate "featured" items.** Don't make one card dark navy and another card red to show importance. Use size, position, and typography weight to create hierarchy instead.

5. **No spinning SVG loader or themed loading animation.** Use a clean, minimal loading animation — a thin progress bar or a simple fade-in is more professional than a custom SVG animation.

6. **No "scroll mouse" indicator at the bottom of the hero.** This is an AI cliché. Remove it entirely.

7. **No generic Font Awesome icons as primary visual interest.** Icons like `fa-leaf`, `fa-tree`, `fa-seedling` in colored boxes are the #1 tell of AI-generated sites. Use typography, photography, and layout instead.

8. **No frosted-glass / backdrop-filter cards floating over gradient backgrounds.** This is the most overused AI pattern. Use solid backgrounds, clean edges, and real content hierarchy.

9. **No letter-spacing: 1-2px uppercase tiny pill labels on every section.** One or two is fine. Every section having an identical "WHAT WE DO" / "ABOUT US" / "TESTIMONIALS" pill tag is a pattern.

10. **No emergency floating call button with a pulsing box-shadow.** Just make the phone number prominent in the nav and hero. A sticky bottom bar on mobile is fine but should be a clean, simple bar — not a floating circle with a glow.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES — DO THESE INSTEAD

**Let typography carry the design.** Use a distinctive display font (not DM Sans, Inter, or Roboto — try something like Outfit, Sora, or General Sans for headings, paired with a clean body font). Use dramatic size contrast between headings and body text. A 56-72px hero heading paired with 16-17px body text creates natural hierarchy without any visual tricks.

**Use a real hero image.** Source from Unsplash. A dark overlay (`linear-gradient` with `rgba` black) over a real photo of a garden center, nursery plants, or landscaped yard instantly grounds the site in reality. The hero text sits on top.

**Give every section a different layout:**
- **Hero:** Full-viewport image background with overlay, large heading, subtitle, CTA buttons, and a row of 3 key stats ("3,275+ Facebook Fans", "Full-Service Nursery", "Delivery Available")
- **Services:** Clean multi-column text list or minimal grid — NO icon boxes. Organize by category (Nursery, Landscape, Materials, Delivery).
- **About/Story:** Asymmetric two-column with the Chase Johnson "started at age 10" story on one side and business growth timeline on the other.
- **Testimonials:** Large, editorial-style quotes — one at a time or staggered, not 5 identical cards in a grid. Think newspaper testimonial layout.
- **Products/Materials:** Image-forward layout showing categories — trees, shrubs, flowers, rocks, mulch, soil.
- **Location/Hours:** Clean split layout with a Google Maps embed on one side and hours + contact info on the other.
- **Contact form:** Simple, clean, minimal. No decorative wrappers.

**Whitespace is your primary design tool.** Sections should have generous padding (100-120px vertical on desktop). Content should never feel cramped. Let things breathe.

**Limit your color usage.** Use your accent color for CTAs and one or two emphasis moments only. Everything else should be your neutral palette (dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds). Restraint makes the accent color impactful.

**Mobile is the priority.** Most visitors will be on phones, searching for a nursery or landscape materials while out running errands. The phone number should be immediately tappable. The site should be fast, clear, and usable at a glance on a 375px screen.

**Testimonials should feel real and important.** Use large quote marks (typographic, like a big `"` character), generous spacing, and let the words speak. Don't shrink them into tiny cards.

**The loading animation should be nearly invisible.** A thin bar across the top of the screen that fills and fades, or a simple full-screen fade-in. Nothing themed, nothing clever.

### Content Priorities (in order of importance)

1. **Phone number** — clickable, prominent (people call to check inventory)
2. **"Started at age 10" owner story** — the human differentiator that beats big-box stores
3. **Service area** — Mont Belvieu, Baytown, Houston corridor
4. **Nursery products** — trees, shrubs, flowers, seasonal plants
5. **Landscape services** — design, installation, ongoing care via Chase's Yard Care
6. **Materials + Delivery** — rocks, mulch, soil, bulk delivery
7. **Hours and location** — FM 1409 location for rural/exurban customers
8. **Facebook link** — 3,275 followers, active community presence
9. **Contact/quote form** — lead capture for landscape projects

---

- Fast load time — minimal dependencies, no heavy frameworks

- Font Awesome is acceptable for small inline icons (social links, phone icon in nav) but should NOT be the visual centerpiece of any section
